# NeuroTechSC - Machine Learning

This is the NeuroTechSC git repository folder for the Machine Learning team. The main goal is to detect subvocal phonemes from surface Electromyography (sEMG) data using a Temporal Multi-Channel Vision Transformer (TMC-ViT) implemented in Python. This repository provides the implementation of the TMC-ViT model, data preprocessing, and training scripts for the sEMG dataset.

## Overview

This project aims to improve the performance of subvocal phoneme detection using machine learning techniques. Subvocal phonemes are the speech components generated when a person talks to themselves without producing any sound. Detecting these phonemes has various applications, including silent communication devices and assistive technologies for individuals with speech impairments.

The TMC-ViT model used in this repository is a novel deep learning architecture that leverages the benefits of vision transformers and temporal multi-channel features to achieve improved performance on sEMG data. This model outperforms conventional methods such as CNNs and LSTMs in subvocal phoneme detection tasks.
