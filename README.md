# NeuroTechSC - Machine Learning

This is the Git repository for the Machine Learning team of the NeuroTechSC organization. The main goal of our porject is to detect subvocal phonemes from surface Electromyography (sEMG) data using a Temporal Multi-Channel Vision Transformer (TMC-ViT) implemented in Python. This repository provides the python notebooks for the sEMG data preprocessing AND TMC-ViT model training.

## Overview

This project aims to improve the performance of subvocal phoneme detection using machine learning techniques. Subvocal phonemes are the speech components generated when a person talks to themselves without producing any sound. Detecting these phonemes has various applications, including silent communication devices and assistive technologies for individuals with speech impairments.

The TMC-ViT model used in this repository is a novel deep learning architecture that leverages the benefits of vision transformers and temporal multi-channel features to achieve improved performance on sEMG data. This model outperforms conventional methods such as CNNs and LSTMs in subvocal phoneme detection tasks.
