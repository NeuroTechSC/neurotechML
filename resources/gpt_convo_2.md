# System

You are an AI programming assistant.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Either give code as output, or write out detailed step-by-step instructions to assist the user in their task.
- Minimize output, be concise but very detailed, and only print the functions/lines you change, don't repeat pieces of code not involved with the problem at hand (if necessary, include surrounding/relevant code that is needed for context)
- Make detailed comments for each new/old line of code that you output.

We've collected sEMG recordings of 5 different phonemes using 4 muscle groups/channels, with ~10 recordings of each phoneme. The data has been preprocessed and adapted to fit the TMC-ViT code/model. Here are the stats on the data we have right now:

len(train_silence): 50
len(train_b): 26
len(train_v): 58
len(train_i): 51
len(train_u): 50
len(train_o): 48

X_train.shape: (283, 4, 100) - 283 training examples, 4 channels (muscle groups) per example, each 100 timesteps long
y_train.shape: (283,) - 283 training labels

I am going to give you the TMC-ViT code section by section, and you will explain the code, what it does and why it was done, then modify it to fit our own data, explaining each change and optimizing the hyperparameters for our specific data/task.

Load the data (already modified):
\# Load the training data
X_train = np.load('./X_train.npy')
y_train = np.load('./y_train.npy')

\# Split into training and testing data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

\# Prepare the data - N training examples, 4 channels (muscle groups) per example, each 100 timesteps long
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 4, 100, 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 4, 100, 1)

print(f"X_train.shape: {X_train.shape} - {X_train.shape[0]} training examples")
print(f"X_test.shape: {X_test.shape} - {X_test.shape[0]} testing examples")

X_train.shape: (226, 4, 100, 1) - 226 training examples
X_test.shape: (57, 4, 100, 1) - 57 testing examples

Will using RNN/LSTM ideas be helpful there? Since the phonemes that come before are relevant to the EMG of the current phoneme.

# Assistant

LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) are a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) that can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data more effectively than traditional RNNs. They maintain an internal state, which allows them to remember and process information over longer time steps.

Incorporating RNN/LSTM ideas would indeed be helpful when you want to predict phonemes in ordered sequences like words or phrases. The LSTM layers can learn the context and dependencies between the phonemes and improve the overall prediction accuracy. When you have sequences of phonemes as input, you can modify the model to accept such sequences and use the LSTM layers to capture the relationships between the phonemes in the sequence. This would help the model to better predict the current phoneme based on the context of the preceding phonemes.

# User

So would I want a model that takes both the current window of EMG recordings, the predicted phonemes that came before, and then outputs the next one? That's why I wanted to use the transformer architecture, it seemed applicable. But I could see it working with RNNs

# Assistant

Yes, you can create a model that takes both the current window of EMG recordings and the predicted phonemes that came before to output the next phoneme. While the transformer architecture is a good choice for handling such tasks, RNNs, especially LSTMs or GRUs, can also be effective in solving sequence-to-sequence problems.

You can modify the current model to accept both the EMG recordings and the preceding phoneme predictions as inputs. Here's a high-level outline of the architecture:

1. Create two separate input layers, one for the EMG recordings and another for the preceding phoneme predictions.
2. Process the EMG recordings using 1D convolutional layers to extract spatial features, as in the current model.
3. Encode the preceding phoneme predictions using an embedding layer to map the discrete phoneme labels to continuous embeddings.
4. Concatenate the processed EMG features and the phoneme embeddings along the time axis.
5. Use LSTM or GRU layers to capture the temporal relationships in the concatenated features.
6. Add dense layers to learn complex relationships between the extracted features.
7. Create an output layer with the number of units equal to the number of classes and a softmax activation function for classification.

This architecture would allow the model to consider both the current EMG recordings and the context of the preceding phonemes when predicting the next phoneme. This can help improve the overall prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with longer sequences of phonemes in words or phrases.
