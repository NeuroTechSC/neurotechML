Subvocalization refers to the internal speech that occurs while reading or thinking without producing any audible sound. It is accompanied by the activation of the muscles involved in speech production, generating electrical signals known as electromyograms (EMGs). These signals can potentially be used for silent communication and assistive technologies, improving the lives of people with speech impairments and enabling new forms of human-computer interaction. However, the accurate recognition of subvocal EMGs remains a challenge due to the variability in signal patterns and electrode placement. Our proposed solution is to develop an advanced subvocal EMG recognition system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the EMG signals, our system will be able to identify the intended speech content and convert it into text. This technology will be applicable in various fields, including silent communication for military or emergency personnel, assistive devices for people with speech impairments, and hands-free control of computers and other electronic devices.
