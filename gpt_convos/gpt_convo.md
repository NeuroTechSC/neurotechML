# User
I am attempting to create an application that can detect/transcribe subvocal speech (or more accurately the phonemes being read). The project is split into four teams, Hardware, Data, Machine Learning, and Software:

Hardware: responsible for the electrode placement, openBCI board settings, recording sEMG readings into a file
Data: Preprocess and clean the data for model training
ML: Use the Temporal Multi-Channel Vision Transformer (TMC-ViT) to train a model to recognize phonemes
Software: Integrate these pipeline stages to create a real-time application

I am currently working as director of the Data and ML Teams. 

Right now, the plan involves these things:

1. Our own data that we record, in the format of simple txt/csv files
2. An online dataset (EMG_UKA) of sEMG readings of audible/whispered/silent speech accompanied by aligned phonemes
3. The paper for EMG_UKA which explains the data collection protocol
4. The paper for the TMC-ViT architecture, originally created to predict 19 hand gestures from sEMG signals in the arm.
5. The python notebook with the TMC-ViT model training code (but no data preprocessing)

So the current issue/challenge is that we can't use data for subvocal sEMG on code for gesture sEMG, we need to adapt the code and/or data. The following facts should be taken into account:

1. EMG_UKA is 1 hour 52 minutes of data, good quaility, can be downloaded, sEMG format is in .adc files
2. The dataset used for training the TMC-ViT is not available for download, but it is called Ninapro DB05, it uses a different number of channels and collection protocol from EMG-UKA (as well as being arm signals)
3. The code for TMC-ViT implies the Ninapro data was in .npy files, ro was preprocessed into them at least
4. Our own data can be collected with almost exactly the same protocol as EMG_UKA, so the data should be similar

From the above information, there are a few options to develop the application:

Option 1 (Pretrained on dataset). Collect our data in a manner as close as possible to the EMG_UKA paper, create a processing script to convert from .adc -> .npy as well .csv -> .npy, then convert EMG_UKA to a proper format, adapt the code to work with subvocal sEMG signals/formatting, then pretrain on EMG_UKA, then finetune and/or test on our own data. Hopefully our accuracy on the dataset is > 90%, and on our own data > 80%.

Option 2 (Trained from scratch). Try to collect all of our training data from scratch, then we only need to process .csv -> .npy, and collect a lot more data to train the model.

Additionally, we plan on first testing/training our model on only 4 phonemes at first, then eventually upscale to all 44 phonemes, and possibly use an error-correction model to turn those phonemes into words/phrases.

Analyze this plan and give your thoughts on the strategies/ideas mentioned. 

# Assistant
Based on your project plan and the options you've provided, I would like to give my thoughts on the strategies and ideas mentioned.

Overall, your project is well-structured with clearly defined roles for each team. The goal of using TMC-ViT to recognize phonemes from sEMG signals is reasonable and achievable.

Regarding the two options you presented, I would recommend going with Option 1 (Pretrained on dataset). Here are my reasons:

1. Leveraging an existing high-quality dataset (EMG_UKA) will save you time and effort, as collecting sEMG data from scratch is a labor-intensive process. Additionally, the EMG_UKA dataset is already aligned with phonemes, making it suitable for training a phoneme recognition model.

2. Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning. By pretraining your model on the EMG_UKA dataset, you'll have a better starting point than training from scratch. This can lead to higher accuracy, faster convergence, and better generalization when fine-tuning on your own data.

3. Adapting the TMC-ViT architecture to work with subvocal sEMG signals is a necessary step regardless of the option chosen. By going with Option 1, you can make use of the existing dataset and model while focusing on adapting the code to handle subvocal sEMG signals/formatting.

4. Focusing on a smaller number of phonemes initially (4 phonemes) is a good strategy for validating your approach before scaling up to all 44 phonemes.

To make Option 1 work, you should:

1. Write the preprocessing script to convert EMG_UKA's .adc files and your own data's .csv files to .npy format, ensuring they are compatible with the TMC-ViT model training code.

2. Adapt the TMC-ViT architecture and training code to handle the different number of channels and collection protocol from EMG_UKA, as well as the subvocal sEMG signals. This may involve adjusting the input shape, modifying the data augmentation methods (if applicable), and possibly making minor architecture changes.

3. Pretrain the TMC-ViT model on the EMG_UKA dataset, then fine-tune it on your own data. Monitor the performance on both datasets to ensure that the model is not overfitting and is generalizing well.

4. Gradually increase the number of phonemes to work towards recognizing all 44 phonemes. Once the phoneme recognition is accurate, you can consider adding an error-correction model to convert phonemes into words/phrases.

5. Regularly communicate your progress and any challenges faced with the Hardware and Software teams to ensure smooth integration of the pipeline stages.

In summary, Option 1 is a more efficient and practical approach that leverages an existing dataset and transfer learning to jumpstart your project. By focusing on preprocessing, adapting the existing TMC-ViT code, and progressively increasing the number of phonemes, you'll be well-positioned to develop a successful subvocal speech recognition application.

# Temporal Multi-Channel Vision Transformer (TMC-ViT)

**Author**: Ricardo V. Godoy <br>
**Description**: This project implements a Transformer-based model called Temporal Multi-Channel Vision Transformer (TMC-ViT). The TMC-ViT was developed to adapt the Vision Transformer model proposed by [Dosovitskiy et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) for processing multi-channel temporal signals as input. In this example, we will predict 18 gestures from the [Ninapro DB05
Database](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186132). <br>
**Requirements**: This model is developed in Keras 2.8.0 and Python 3.7.x.

Give me a description of what each section does, what the data (the .npy) files are formatted like for this to work, and what changes will likely be needed to adapt the code for the previously mentioned purpose.

# Assistant
Here's a description of each section in the TMC-ViT notebook code:

1. Import libraries: Importing the necessary libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and Keras.

2. Load the data: Loading the preprocessed data from .npy files into training and test sets, and reshaping the data to fit the model's input requirements. The data format for the .npy files is as follows:
    - X_train and X_test: These are 4-dimensional arrays (number of samples, number of EMG channels, number of time steps, 1) representing sEMG signals.
    - y_train and y_test: These are 1-dimensional arrays containing the corresponding gesture labels for each sample.

3. Define the model parameters: Setting the hyperparameters for the TMC-ViT model, such as the number of output classes, input shape, patch size, and architecture details.

4. Define the MLP and other helper functions: Defining the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and other helper functions that will be used in the TMC-ViT model.

5. Define the patch class and patch encoder: Defining custom Keras layers to extract patches from the input signals and encode them with positional embeddings.

6. Create the TMC-ViT classifier: Creating a function that builds the TMC-ViT model using the previously defined helper functions, patch class, and patch encoder.

7. Create token embedding: Creating a sequential model consisting of convolutional, batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout layers to extract embeddings from the input signals.

8. Create the classifier: Calling the function to create the TMC-ViT classifier using the defined model parameters and token embedding.

9. Compile the model: Compiling the model with the appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric.

10. Define callback: Defining an early stopping callback to stop training when the validation accuracy stops improving.

11. Train the model: Training the TMC-ViT model on the prepared dataset using the defined callback.

12. Evaluate the model: Evaluating the trained model on the test dataset to get the final performance metrics.

To adapt this code for subvocal sEMG signals and the EMG_UKA dataset, you'll likely need to make the following changes:

1. Update the number of EMG channels and time steps to match the EMG_UKA dataset and your own data. This will affect the input_shape, image_size1, and image_size2 variables.

2. Modify the model architecture, such as the number of output classes (num_classes) and the token embedding, to better suit subvocal sEMG signals. Experiment with different combinations of convolutional, pooling, and dropout layers in the token_emb model.

3. Adjust the patch size (patch_size) and other hyperparameters to match the characteristics of subvocal sEMG signals.

4. Replace the Ninapro DB05 dataset with the EMG_UKA dataset and your own data. Ensure that the data is preprocessed and formatted consistently with the original code's expectations. You may need to adjust the data loading and preprocessing steps to accommodate the new data format (.adc or .csv instead of .npy).

5. Fine-tune the model on your own data after pretraining it on the EMG_UKA dataset. You can split your data into training and validation sets and monitor the performance on both datasets during training.

6. Finally, adjust the model training parameters, such as the batch size and number of epochs, to achieve the desired level of accuracy and convergence.

# User
So what is:

X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 16, 40, 1)

and what does each value represent?

# Assistant
The line `X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 16, 40, 1)` reshapes the `X_train` array into a new shape with the specified dimensions. Here's what each value represents:

- `-1`: This is a placeholder that indicates the size of this dimension should be automatically computed based on the total number of elements in the array and the specified sizes of the other dimensions. In this case, it represents the number of samples in the training set.

- `16`: This represents the number of EMG channels in the input data.

- `40`: This represents the number of time steps in the input data.

- `1`: This represents the number of channels in the image-like data format. Since the EMG data is not an actual image, and instead a 2D array (channels x time steps), we use a single channel to represent the data.

The purpose of reshaping `X_train` in this manner is to convert it into a format that the TMC-ViT model can process. The model expects input data in the form of 4-dimensional tensors (number of samples, height, width, number of channels), similar to image data. In this case, the height corresponds to the number of EMG channels, the width corresponds to the number of time steps, and there is a single "channel" since the data is not an actual image with multiple color channels.

# User
So give me an example of what ./X_train.npy would look like

# Assistant
The `./X_train.npy` file contains the preprocessed training data for the TMC-ViT model. It represents the sEMG signals for multiple samples, where the number of EMG channels and time steps correspond to the dimensions specified in the code.

Here's an example of what the content of `./X_train.npy` might look like:

```
[
  [
    [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ..., 0.02],  // sEMG signal for Channel 1 (40 time steps)
    [0.04, 0.05, 0.06, ..., 0.04],  // sEMG signal for Channel 2 (40 time steps)
    ...
    [0.07, 0.08, 0.09, ..., 0.08]   // sEMG signal for Channel 16 (40 time steps)
  ],  // Sample 1

  [
    [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, ..., 0.03],  // sEMG signal for Channel 1 (40 time steps)
    [0.05, 0.06, 0.07, ..., 0.05],  // sEMG signal for Channel 2 (40 time steps)
    ...
    [0.08, 0.09, 0.10, ..., 0.09]   // sEMG signal for Channel 16 (40 time steps)
  ],  // Sample 2

  ...
  
  [
    [0.03, 0.04, 0.05, ..., 0.04],  // sEMG signal for Channel 1 (40 time steps)
    [0.06, 0.07, 0.08, ..., 0.06],  // sEMG signal for Channel 2 (40 time steps)
    ...
    [0.09, 0.10, 0.11, ..., 0.10]   // sEMG signal for Channel 16 (40 time steps)
  ]   // Sample N
]
```

In this example, `./X_train.npy` is a 3-dimensional array where the first dimension represents the number of samples, the second dimension corresponds to the number of EMG channels (16 in this case), and the third dimension represents the sEMG signal values for each channel over 40 time steps.

Keep in mind that this example uses dummy values for the sEMG signal data, and the actual values in the `./X_train.npy` file would depend on the specific dataset and preprocessing steps used.

# User
Okay so if that really is the way the .npy files looks, the data processing of csv files shouldn't be too difficult, just get values and arrange them properly. But what do the .adc files looks like? Here's the file hierarchy of EMG_UKA:

EMG-UKA-Trial-Corpus
- Alignments (lots of .txt files)
- Subsets (has files like test.audible which contain "emg_002-001: emg_002-001-0122 emg_002-001-0143 emg_002-001-0146...") 
- Supplementary (dictionary.full, dictionary.test, phoneList)
- Transcripts (lots of .txt files)
- audio (lots of .wav files)
- emg (lots of .adc files)
- offset (lots of .txt files)

How would the values in .adc files look? And what application can I use to edit/view the .adc emg spectrograms?

# Assistant
The .adc files in the EMG_UKA dataset contain raw sEMG data in a binary format. Each .adc file corresponds to a specific recording session, and the file stores the sEMG signals as a series of raw integer values. To process these files, you will need to read and decode the binary data into a more usable format, such as NumPy arrays.

To read the .adc files, you can use Python's built-in `open()` function in binary mode and read the raw integer values using the `struct` library. Here's an example of how you might read an .adc file:

```python
import struct

def read_adc_file(file_path, num_channels, num_samples):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        raw_data = f.read()
        data = struct.unpack(f'<{num_channels * num_samples}h', raw_data)
        emg_data = np.array(data).reshape(num_samples, num_channels)
    return emg_data
```

In this example, `file_path` is the path to the .adc file, `num_channels` is the number of EMG channels in the recording, and `num_samples` is the total number of samples in the recording. The function reads the binary data from the file and unpacks it into signed 16-bit integers using the `struct.unpack()` function. It then reshapes the data into a 2D NumPy array with the shape `(num_samples, num_channels)`.

To process the .adc files, you will first need to determine the number of channels and samples for each file. This information may be available in the accompanying metadata files or documentation.

To visualize the sEMG spectrograms, you can use Python libraries such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to create plots of the data. Once you have read and formatted the sEMG data from the .adc files, you can use the following code to display a heatmap of the sEMG spectrogram:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def plot_spectrogram(emg_data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    sns.heatmap(emg_data.T, cmap='viridis')
    plt.xlabel('Time Steps')
    plt.ylabel('EMG Channels')
    plt.show()

emg_data = read_adc_file('path/to/your/adc/file', num_channels, num_samples)
plot_spectrogram(emg_data)
```

This code creates a heatmap of the sEMG data with the time steps on the x-axis and the EMG channels on the y-axis. The heatmap color intensity represents the amplitude of the sEMG signal at each time step and channel.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/adc/file'` with the actual file path of your .adc file and set the correct values for `num_channels` and `num_samples` based on the specific recording.
